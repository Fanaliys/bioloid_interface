# bioloid_interface
ROS connection from RVIZ or Gazebo to the real robot Bioloid Type A

ROS INDIGO

By the time of uploading this files, I don't remember where I got most of the program from.
However I know that I wrote the bioloid_joint program.

To use the program please launch bioloid_joint in ROS.

Depending on what you want to connect either RVIZ or Gazebo, please edit the bioloid_joint.cpp and select the program line and do a catkin_make.

This program is meant to be used to connect Bioloid Type A robots with its RVIZ or Gazebo project that I uploaded in my repository.
